        <b>Blaze company</b>, Brno, Czech Republic – (2022 – 2024)
      </p>
      <p>
        At Blaze company I developed a mobile application focused on personal
        security in Flutter and later on in React Native. (Flutter, Firebase,
        RN, TS, TailwindCSS, Prisma, tRPC)

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-2">Freelance Development</h3>

        <b>Self-taught</b>, Ostrava, Czech Republic – (2022 – present)
      </p>
      <p>
        As a self-taught frontend developer, I am passionate about building
        beautiful and functional websites and applications. I am constantly
        seeking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends
        and technologies. To do so, I am pursuing online courses and personal
        projects, where I can apply my knowledge and learn from my mistakes.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started as a freelance developer. This included building websites for various
        small businesses and maintaining them. I chose modern technologies like Next,
        Prisma or TailwindCSS to accomplish this.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-2">Personal projects</h3>

        <b>Hobby</b>, Czech Republic – (2019 – present)
      </p>
      <p>
        I engaged in several enjoyable small-scale projects, with my favourite
        one being a scientific Fortran program that I developed during an
        internship at a local university. This program was dedicated to
        computing the most energy-efficient configuration of multiple particles
        for various materials. It harnessed the power of a Monte Carlo algorithm
        and incorporated fundamental quantum physics formulas.
